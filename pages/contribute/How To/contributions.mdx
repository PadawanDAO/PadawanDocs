# Contributions

There's tons of ways to help out PadawanDAO beyond donating - and of those ways is making contributions. PadawanDAO is an ever-growing community so we appreciate all the help we can get to continue to make us a great organization. The best way to get invovled with any contributions is to join the [Discord](https://t.co/2gTaDdEhR6) and check out the corresponding WG (working group) for announcements and updates. 

## Technical Contributions

If you're a web developer who knows their way around front-end or back-end, PadawanDAO can always use your help on the technical side of things. After checking out the #technical-wg in our Discord, you can jump over to the PadawanDAO [Github](https://github.com/PadawanDAO) to start fixing or buildining anything that needs to be worked on.

## Social Contributions 

We love our community, so we focus a lot of time on making sure our socials are always active. PadawanDAO would love to hear your ideas on what we can post, new social media campaigns we can launch, and anything else that you think can help us improve. If you've seen our Twitter, you'll know that we like to post some pretty funny stuff on there - so if you've got jokes, this is your time to shine.
